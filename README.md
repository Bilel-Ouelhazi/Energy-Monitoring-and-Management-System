# Energy-Monitoring-and-Management-System
This project implements an Energy Monitoring System using Flask and MongoDB. It allows users to monitor real-time energy consumption data and visualize trends over time. The system collects data from sensors connected to ESP32 microcontrollers and provides a user-friendly web interface for data visualization and analysis.

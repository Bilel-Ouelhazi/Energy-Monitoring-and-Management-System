# Energy Monitoring and Management System

This project implements an Energy Monitoring System using Flask and MongoDB. It allows users to monitor real-time energy consumption data and visualize trends over time. The system collects data from sensors connected to ESP32 microcontrollers and provides a user-friendly web interface for data visualization and analysis.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of voltage, current, power, and energy consumption.
- Daily, monthly, and yearly energy consumption trends visualization.
- User authentication with admin and user access levels.
- Configuration settings for setting maximum energy consumption limits.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Flask)
- MongoDB
- ESP32

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the Flask application and MongoDB database.
3. Upload the ESP32 firmware to the microcontrollers and deploy sensors.
4. Run the Flask application.
5. Access the web interface to monitor and manage energy consumption data.
